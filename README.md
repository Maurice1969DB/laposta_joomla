Laposta newsletters in Joomla 3.x

This is a development version. It is not yet for ready production.

It shows a list of links to newsletters, sorted on date. 

It depends on the Laposta [API](https://github.com/laposta/laposta-api-php) that should be installed in the libraries folder.

An API key is needed and can be set in the config of the module in Joomla.
