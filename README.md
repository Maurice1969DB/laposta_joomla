Laposta newsletters in Joomla 3.x

This is a development version. It is not yet for ready production.

It shows a list of links to newsletters, sorted on date. 

It depends on the Laposta [API](https://github.com/laposta/laposta-api-php) that should be installed in the libraries folder.

The zip file contains only the module. It can be used to upload the module to Joomla.

An API key is needed and can be set in the config of the module in Joomla.
